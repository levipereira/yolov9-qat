# YOLOv9 QAT for TensorRT  Detection / Segmentation 

This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv9 with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), specifically designed for deployment on platforms utilizing TensorRT for hardware-accelerated inference. <br>
This implementation aims to provide an efficient, low-latency version of YOLOv9 for real-time detection applications.<br>
If you do not intend to deploy your model using TensorRT, it is recommended not to proceed with this implementation.

- The files in this repository represent a patch that adds QAT functionality to the original [YOLOv9 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9/).
- This patch is intended to be applied to the main YOLOv9 repository to incorporate the ability to train with QAT.
- The implementation is optimized to work efficiently with TensorRT, an inference library that leverages hardware acceleration to enhance inference performance.
- Users interested in implementing object detection using YOLOv9 with QAT on TensorRT platforms can benefit from this repository as it provides a ready-to-use solution.


We use [TensorRT's pytorch quntization tool](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/main/tools/pytorch-quantization) to finetune training QAT yolov9 from the pre-trained weight, then export the model to onnx and deploy it with TensorRT. The accuray and performance can be found in below table.

For those who are not familiar with QAT, I highly recommend watching this video:<br> [Quantization explained with PyTorch - Post-Training Quantization, Quantization-Aware Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VdNflU08yA)

**Important**<br>
Evaluation of the segmentation model using TensorRT is currently under development. Once I have more available time, I will complete and release this work.

ðŸŒŸ We still have plenty of nodes to improve Q/DQ, and we rely on the community's contribution to enhance this project, benefiting us all. Let's collaborate and make it even better! ðŸš€ 

## Release Highlights
- This release includes an upgrade from TensorRT 8 to TensorRT 10, ensuring compatibility with the CUDA version supported - by the latest NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs.
- The inference has been upgraded utilizing `enqueueV3` instead `enqueueV2`.<br>
- To maintain legacy support for TensorRT 8, a [dedicated branch](https://github.com/levipereira/yolov9-qat/tree/TensorRT-8) has been created. **Outdated** <br>
- We've added a new option `val_trt.sh --generate-graph` which enables [Graph Rendering](#generate-tensort-profiling-and-svg-image) functionality. This feature facilitates the creation of graphical representations of the engine plan in SVG image format.

## QAT Training (Finetune)

In this section, we'll outline the steps to perform Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) using fine-tuning. <br> **Please note that the supported quantization mode is fine-tuning only.** <br> The model should be trained using the original implementation train.py, and after training and reparameterization of the model, the user should proceed with quantization.

### Steps:

1. **Train the Model Using [Training Session](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#training):** 
   - Utilize the original implementation train.py to train your YOLOv9 model with your dataset and desired configurations.
   - Follow the training instructions provided in the original YOLOv9 repository to ensure proper training.

2. **Reparameterize the Model [reparameterization.py](https://github.com/sunmooncode/yolov9/blob/main/tools/reparameterization.py):**
   - After completing the training, reparameterize the trained model to prepare it for quantization. This step is crucial for ensuring that the model's weights are in a suitable format for quantization.

3. **[Proceed with Quantization](#quantize-model):**
   - Once the model is reparameterized, proceed with the quantization process. This involves applying the Quantization-Aware Training technique to fine-tune the model's weights, taking into account the quantization effects.

4. **[Eval Pytorch](#evaluate-using-pytorch)  / [Eval TensorRT](#evaluate-using-tensorrt):**
   - After quantization, it's crucial to validate the performance of the quantized model to ensure that it meets your requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
   - Test the quantized model thoroughly at both stages: during the quantization phase using PyTorch and after training using TensorRT.
   - Please note that different versions of TensorRT may yield varying results and perfomance

5. **Export to ONNX:**
   - [Export ONNX](#export-onnx)
   - Once you are satisfied with the quantized model's performance, you can proceed to export it to ONNX format.

6. **Deploy with TensorRT:**
   - [Deployment with TensorRT](#deployment-with-tensorrt)
   - After exporting to ONNX, you can deploy the model using TensorRT for hardware-accelerated inference on platforms supporting TensorRT.

 





By following these steps, you can successfully perform Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) using fine-tuning with your YOLOv9 model.

## Generate TensoRT Profiling and SVG image


TensorRT Explorer can be installed by executing `./install_dependencies.sh --trex`.<br> This installation is necessary to enable the generation of Graph SV, allowing visualization of the profiling data for a TensorRT engine.

# Export ONNX 
The goal of exporting to ONNX is to deploy to TensorRT, not to ONNX runtime. So we only export fake quantized model into a form TensorRT will take. Fake quantization will be broken into a pair of QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear ONNX ops. TensorRT will take the generated ONNX graph, and execute it in int8 in the most optimized way to its capability.

```bash 
python3 export_qat.py --weights runs/qat/yolov9_qat/weights/qat_best_yolov9-c.pt --include onnx --dynamic --simplify --inplace

## Export ONNX Model End2End
```bash
python3 export_qat.py  --weights runs/qat/yolov9_qat/weights/qat_best_yolov9-c.pt --include onnx_end2end
```


## Deployment with Tensorrt
```bash
 /usr/src/tensorrt/bin/trtexec \
